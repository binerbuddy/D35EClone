While most succumb to madness, some can channel their emotions to make raw psionic powers grow and expand, often beyond the capabilities of other more tame minds. This ability does not come cheap, however, and some of the Wilders pay the ultimate price, laughing their last laugh when annihilating the minds of their foes along with their own.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Alignment:</strong> Any.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d6.</p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\">Class Skills</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">The wilder’s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Autohypnosis* (Wis), Balance (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Concentration* (Con), Craft (Int), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Jump (Str), Knowledge (psionics)* (Int), Listen (Wis), Profession (Wis), Psicraft* (Int), Sense Motive (Wis), Spot (Wis), Swim (Str), and Tumble (Dex).</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">*New skill or expanded use of existing skill.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Skill Points at 1st Level: </strong>(4 + Int modifier) x4.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Skill Points at Each Additional Level:</strong> 4 + Int modifier.</p>\n<p><br><span style=\"font-size: 13px; opacity: 0.8;\">Artwork by Dean Spencer.</span></p>",

Her base daily allotment of power points is given on Table: The Wilder. In addition, she receives bonus power points per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Power Points). Her race may also provide bonus power points per day, as may certain feats and items.</p>\n<p><strong>Powers Known:</strong>&nbsp;A wilder begins play knowing one wilder power of your choice. At every even-numbered class level after 1st, she unlocks the knowledge of new powers.</p>\n<p>Choose the powers known from the wilder power list. (Exception:&nbsp;The feats Expanded Knowledge and Epic Expanded Knowledge do allow a wilder to learn powers from the lists of other classes.) A wilder can manifest any power that has a power point cost equal to or lower than her manifester level.</p>\n<p>The total number of powers a wilder can manifest in a day is limited only by her daily power points.</p>\n<p>A wilder simply knows her powers; they are ingrained in her mind. She does not need to prepare them (in the way that some spellcasters prepare their spells), though she must get a good night’s sleep each day to regain all her spent power points.</p>\n<p>The Difficulty Class for saving throws against wilder powers is 10 + the power’s level + the wilder’s Charisma modifier.</p>\n<p><strong>Maximum Power Level Known:&nbsp;</strong>A wilder begins play with the ability to learn 1st-level powers. As she attains higher levels, she may gain the ability to master more complex powers.</p>\n<p>To learn or manifest a power, a wilder must have a Charisma score of at least 10 + the power’s level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "A wilder’s temperamental mind is hard to encompass with the discipline of telepathy. When any telepathy power is manifested on a wilder of 5th level or higher, the manifester of the power must pay 1 power point more than he otherwise would have spent.  The extra cost is not a natural part of that power’s cost. It does not augment the power; it is simply a wasted power point. The wilder’s volatile mind can force the manifester of the telepathy power to exceed the normal power point limit of 1 point per manifester level. If the extra cost raises the telepathy power’s cost to more points than the manifester has remaining in his reserve, the power simply fails, and the manifester exhausts the rest of his power points.  At 9th level, the penalty assessed against telepathy powers manifested on a wilder is increased to 2 power points. At 13th level, the penalty increases to 3 power points, and at 17th level it increases to 4 power points.  As a standard action, a wilder can choose to lower this effect for 1 round."
