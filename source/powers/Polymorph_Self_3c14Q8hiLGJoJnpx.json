A body with extra limbs does not allow a character to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. Natural abilities also include mundane movement capabilities, such as walking, swimming, and flight with wings.\n</p><p>The character does not acquire the extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like abilities of the new form. The character cannot change into variation form of a creature. Incorporeal or gaseous forms cannot be assumed.\n</p><p>The character retains his or her Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma sores, level and class, hit point (despite any change to the character's Constitution score), alignment, base attack bonus and save bonuses. (New Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores may affect final attack and save bonuses.) The character retains his or her extraordinary abilities, spells, and spell-like abilities, but not his or her supernatural abilities (if any). The character can manifest powers, or cast spells for which the character has components, but the character needs a humanlike voice for verbal components and humanlike hands for somatic components.\n</p><p>If the character's new form is a fey, giant, humanoid, shapechanger, or undead, the character's equipment changes to match the new form and retains its properties. Otherwise, it melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional. Melded material components and focuses cannot be used to cast spells. Any part of the body or piece of equipment that is separated from the whole reverts to its original form.\n</p><p>The character chooses the form's physical qualities (such as hair color, height, and gender), but they must fall within the normal ranges for the form. The character is effectively disguised as an average member of the new form's race. If the character uses this power to create a disguise, the character gets a +10 bonus on his or her disguise check.\n</p>\n<hr/>\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n",
