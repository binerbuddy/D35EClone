The manifester can bring the astral forms of other creatures with him or her, provided the creatures are linked in a circle with the manifester at the time of the manifestation. These fellow travelers are dependent upon the manifester and must accompany him or her at all times. If something happens to the manifester during the journey, the companions are stranded wherever he or she left them.\n</p><p>The manifester projects his or her astral self into the Astral Plane, leaving his or her physical body behind on the Material Plane in a state of suspended animation. The power projects an astral copy of the manifester and all he of she wears or carries onto the Astral Plane. Since the Astral Plane touches upon every other plane, the manifester can travel astrally to other planes. The manifester then leaves the Astral Plane, forming a new physical body (and equipment) on the plane of existence he or she has chosen to enter.\n</p><p>On the Astral Plane or any outer plane, the astral body is connected at all times to the material body by a silvery cord. If the cord is broken, the affected person is killed, astrally and materially. Very few things can destroy a silver cord. When a second body is formed on a different plane, the incorporeal silvery cord remains invisibly attached to the new body. If the second body or astral form is slain, the cord simply returns to the person's body where it rests on the Material Plane, reviving it from its state of suspended animation. Although astral projections are able to function on the Astral Plane, their actions affect only creatures existing on the Astral Plane; a physical body must be materialized on other planes.\n</p><p>The manifester and companions may travel through the Astral Plane indefinitely. Their bodies simply wait behind in a state of suspended animation until they choose to return their spirits to their physical bodies. The power lasts until the manifester desires to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as negate psionics manifested upon either the physical body or the astral form, or the destruction of the body back on the Material Plane (which kills the character).\n</p>\n<hr/>\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n",
