Studied carefully is a place known well, either because the manifester has been there often or has used other means to study the place. Seen casually is a place that the manifester has seen more than once but with which he or she is not very familiar. Viewed once is a place that the manifester has seen once, possibly using psionics. Description is a place whose location and appearance are know through someone else's description, perhaps even from a precise map.\n</p><p>False destination is a place that doesn't exist.

Distance off target is 1d10x1d10% of the distance that was to be traveled.\n</p><p>Similar Area: The manifester winds up in an area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. Generally, the manifester appears in the closest similar place, but since the power has no range limit, he or she could conceivably wind up somewhere else across the globe.\n</p><p>Mishap: The manifester and anyone else teleporting with him or her have gotten scrambled.

Each time Mishap comes up, the characters suffer more damage and must reroll.\n</p>\n<hr/>\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n",
