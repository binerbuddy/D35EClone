An opponent that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to your frightful presence for 24 hours. Frightful presence is a mind-affecting fear effect.\n</p><p>Your horrific form grants you a natural armor bonus of +5, damage reduction 5/–, and a +4 bonus to your Strength score. In addition, you gain +10 feet to your land speed as well as a +10 bonus on Climb and Jump checks.\n</p><p>A nest of violently flailing black tentacles sprout from your hair and back. You can make up to four additional attacks with these tentacles in addition to your regular melee attacks in each round that you take a full attack action. You can make tentacle attacks within the space you normally threaten. If you make your tentacle attacks in addition to you regular melee attacks, each tentacle attacks at your highest base attack bonus with a –5 penalty. If you forgo all your other attacks, making only tentacle attacks, you make your tentacle attacks at your highest base attack bonus with no penalty. These tentacles deal 2d8 points of damage plus one-half your Strength bonus on each successful strike.\n</p><p>This power functions only while you inhabit your base form (for instance, you can’t be metamorphed or polymorphed into another form, though you can use <i>claws of the beast</i>, and <i>bite of the wolf </i>in conjunction with this power for your regular attacks), and while your mind resides within your own body.\n</p><p><b>Augment:</b> For every additional power point you spend, this power’s duration increases by 2 rounds.\n</p>\n<hr/>\n\n\n\n</div>\n",
