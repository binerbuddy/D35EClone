The manifester must be at least the minimum level required to manifest the power. This power has no effect on powers that already create a permanent effect. A character can't incarnate a power with no duration or a duration of instantaneous. A character can't incarnate a power that has an XP cost of its own, nor can a character incarnate a power of level 6 or higher. The manifester must expend XP when manifesting this power. A character can never expend so much XP that doing so would drop the character one or more levels (though a character could forgo gaining a level in order to incarnate a particularly costly power). The XP costs vary depending on the target.\n</p><p>Incarnate can be negated by a higher-level psion who also manifests incarnate or by use of psychic chirurgery.\n</p><p>The GM may not allow some powers to become permanent through incarnate. The manifester knows before attempting to incarnate a power if it can or cannot be made permanent.\n</p><p>XP Cost: To make a power permanent in regard to the manifester's self, he or she must expend a number of XP equal to the power's level x 300. To make a power permanent in regard to another creature, the manifester must expend a number of XP equal to the power's level x 600. To make a power permanent on an object or location, the manifester must expend a number of XP equal to the power's level x 900.\n</p>\n<hr/>\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n",
