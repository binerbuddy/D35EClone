If manifest on someone else, neither the manifester nor his or her allies can see the subject, unless the manifester can normally see invisible things or employ psionics to do so.\n</p><p>Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so. Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from her becomes visible.\n</p><p>The subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable. The power ends the second time the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this power, an attack includes any power targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. (Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character's perceptions.) Actions directed at unattended objects do not negate the power. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Note that powers that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area.\n</p><p>An invisible attacker gains a +2 bonus on his attack roll (for the two attacks, either melee or ranged, that are allowed before becoming visible), and the defender against such an attack loses any Dexterity bonus to Armor Class.\n</p>\n<hr/>\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n",
