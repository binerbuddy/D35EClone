Only one sense is linked, and the manifester may not switch between senses with the same manifestation. Once sense link is manifested, the link persists even if the subject creature moves out of the original manifestation range (but the link does not work across planes). The manifester does not control the creature, nor can the manifester communicate with it via this power.\n</p><p>The manifester must concentrate to access the sense link. If he or she does not concentrate, that sense returns to the manifester's own immediate surroundings. The powers of the manifester's senses could be enhanced by other powers or items, if desired, allowing the subject creature the same enhanced sense. A successful negate psionics manifested on the manifester or the linked creature ends the power. With respect to the subject creature's own blindness, deafness, and so on, the manifester is an independent sensory organ. When linked to the manifester, the subject may make his or her own perception checks, such as Spot and Listen, regardless of the manifester's Spot and Listen results, if any.\n</p><p>This power can be used to damage the subject. For example, if the manifester links taste and then eats something particularly foul (GM's discretion), the subject creature must make another Will save against the original DC or be stunned for 1 round. If the manifester eats something that causes damage, the subject creature takes no damage but must make a saving throw against the original DC or be stunned for 1d2 rounds. Likewise, if the manifester links sight and is subject to a gaze attack, so is the subject.\n</p>\n<hr/>\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n",
