The space within this barrier is totally impervious to most psionic effects. Likewise, it prevents the functioning of any psionic items or psionic powers within its confines. The field suppresses any powers or psionic effects used within, brought into, or manifested into the area, but does not negate them. Time spent within a null psionics field counts against the suppressed power's duration.\n</p><p>Astral constructs wink out if they enter the field (or are inside one when it is created). The construct reappears in the same spot once the null psionics field no longer covers the spot where the construct was. Time spent winked out counts normally against the duration of the power that's maintaining the creature. If the construct has power resistance, when the character manifested the null psionics field the character must make a manifester level check (1d20 + manifester level) against the construct's PR to make it wink out.\n</p><p>A psionic weapon does not function psionically within the area, but it is still a weapon (and a masterwork one at that). The power has no effect on constructs that are imbued with psionics during their creation process and are thereafter self-supporting (unlike astral constructs that persist only so long as a power's duration). Undead and outsiders are likewise unaffected (unless summoned). These creatures' psionic powers, spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities, however, may be temporarily nullified by the field.\n</p><p>A negate psionics power does not remove the field. Two or more null psionics fields have no appreciable effect on each other. Artifacts, relics, and creatures of demigod or higher status are unaffected by mortal psionics such as this.\n</p><p>Note: Should the manifester be larger than the area enclosed by the field, any part of his or her person that lies outside the field is unaffected by the field.\n</p>\n<hr/>\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n",
