Demiplanes created by this power are very small, very minor planes.\n</p><p>This power should be manifested only while the manifester is on the Ethereal or Astral Plane.\n</p><p>At first, the fledgling plane grows at a rate of 1 foot in radius per day to an initial maximum radius of 10 feet per manifester level. Once the new demiplane reaches its maximum size, it doesn't really stop growing, but its growth rate decreases dramatically to only 1/2 inch in radius per week (just over 2 feet per year).\n</p><p>The environment within the demiplane is determined by the manifester when genesis is first manifested, reflecting most any desire the psion can visualize, as long as the GM approves (although no environmental effect within the plane can duplicate effects greater than those of 3rd-level powers). Factors such as solid ground, air, water, and temperature must be determined by the manifester. This power cannot create life, nor can it create construction; such particulars must be introduced to the demiplane in some other fashion. All demiplanes created with genesis are in contact with the Astral and Ethereal Planes.\n</p><p>Antigenesis: It is possible to manifest genesis on normal planes and demiplanes, but only the most perverse or evil shaper would consider doing so. If genesis is manifested within a normal plane or demiplane, the power takes effect according to the speed noted above; however, the energies of the new plane are exactly canceled by the energies of the original plane, creating a growing dead spot like on the original plane. The expanding boundary of the dead spot utterly wipes away all construction, crumbles natural land forms, and evaporates water, leaving behind a uniformly level plain of inert dust. Living things that pass the boundary of the growing dead spot are not directly harmed. But plants can find no sustenance in the dust of the dead spot, marine creatures die even more quickly when water turns to dust, and mobile animals know enough to leave the area alone. An antigenesis wave dies out after 100d10 years, or can be canceled by yet another manifestation of genesis.\n</p>\n<hr/>\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n",
