The text containing the symbol must be at least twenty-five words long. When anyone reads the text containing the symbol, the <i>sepia snake </i>springs into being and strikes the reader, provided there is line of effect between the symbol and the reader.\n</p><p>Simply seeing the enspelled text is not sufficient to trigger the spell; the subject must deliberately read it. The target is entitled to a save to evade the snake’s strike. If it succeeds, the <i>sepia snake </i>dissipates in a flash of brown light accompanied by a puff of dun-colored smoke and a loud noise. If the target fails its save, it is engulfed in a shimmering amber field of force and immobilized until released, either at your command or when 1d4 days + one day per caster level have elapsed.\n</p><p>While trapped in the amber field of force, the subject does not age, breathe, grow hungry, sleep, or regain spells. It is preserved in a state of suspended animation, unaware of its surroundings. It can be damaged by outside forces (and perhaps even killed), since the field provides no protection against physical injury. However, a dying subject does not lose hit points or become stable until the spell ends.\n</p><p>The hidden sigil cannot be detected by normal observation, and <i>detect magic </i>reveals only that the entire text is magical.\n</p><p>A <i>dispel magic </i>can remove the sigil. An <i>erase </i>spell destroys the entire page of text.\n</p><p><i>Sepia snake sigil </i>can be cast in combination with other spells that hide or garble text, such as <i>secret page.</i>\n</p><p><i>Material Component: </i>500 gp worth of powdered amber, a scale from any snake, and a pinch of mushroom spores.\n</p>\n<hr/>\n\n\n\n</div>\n",
