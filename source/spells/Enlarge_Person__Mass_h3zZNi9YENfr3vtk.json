If it fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it— the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by increasing its size.\n</p><p>All equipment worn or carried by a creature is similarly enlarged by the spell. Melee and projectile weapons affected by this spell deal more damage. Other magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any <i>enlarged </i>item that leaves an <i>enlarged </i>creature’s possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown weapons deal their normal damage, and projectiles deal damage based on the size of the weapon that fired them.
