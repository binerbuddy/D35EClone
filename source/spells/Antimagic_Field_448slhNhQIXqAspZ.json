Time spent winked out counts normally against the duration of the conjuration that is maintaining the creature. If you cast <i>antimagic field </i>in an area occupied by a summoned creature that has spell resistance, you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against the creature’s spell resistance to make it wink out.

Furthermore, while a magic sword does not function magically within the area, it is still a sword (and a masterwork sword at that). The spell has no effect on golems and other constructs that are imbued with magic during their creation process and are thereafter self-supporting (unless they have been summoned, in which case they are treated like any other summoned creatures). Elementals, corporeal undead, and outsiders are likewise unaffected unless summoned. These creatures’ spell-like or supernatural abilities, however, may be temporarily nullified by the field. <i>Dispel magic </i>does not remove the field.\n</p><p>Two or more <i>antimagic fields </i>sharing any of the same space have no effect on each other. Certain spells, such as <i>wall of force, prismatic sphere</i>, and <i>prismatic wall, </i>remain unaffected by <i>antimagic field </i>(see the individual spell descriptions). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.\n</p><p>Should a creature be larger than the area enclosed by the barrier, any part of it that lies outside the barrier is unaffected by the field.\n</p><p><i>Arcane Material Component: </i>A pinch of powdered iron or iron filings.\n</p>\n<hr/>\n\n\n\n</div>\n",
