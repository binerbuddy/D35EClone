If the save or spell resistance is successful, the gem shatters.\n</p><p><i>Trigger Object: </i>The second method is far more insidious, for it tricks the subject into accepting a trigger object inscribed with the final spell word, automatically placing the creature’s soul in the trap. To use this method, both the creature’s name and the trigger word must be inscribed on the trigger object when the gem is enspelled. A <i>sympathy </i>spell can also be placed on the trigger object. As soon as the subject picks up or accepts the trigger object, its life force is automatically transferred to the gem without the benefit of spell resistance or a save.\n</p><p><i>Material Component: </i>Before the actual casting of <i>trap the soul, </i>you must procure a gem of at least 1,000 gp value for every Hit Die possessed by the creature to be trapped.
