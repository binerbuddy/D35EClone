You can resurrect a creature that has been dead for as long as 10 years per caster level. This spell can even bring back creatures whose bodies have been destroyed, provided that you unambiguously identify the deceased in some fashion (reciting the deceased’s time and place of birth or death is the most common method). In addition, the subject’s soul must be free and willing to return. If the subject’s soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no saving throw.\n</p><p>Upon completion of the spell, the creature is immediately restored to full hit points, vigor, and health, with no loss of level (or Constitution points) or prepared spells.\n</p><p>None of the dead creature’s equipment or possessions are affected in any way by this spell.\n</p><p>You can revive someone killed by a death effect or someone who has been turned into an undead creature and then destroyed. This spell can also resurrect elementals or outsiders, but it can’t resurrect constructs or undead creatures.\n</p><p>Even <i>true resurrection </i>can’t restore to life a creature who has died of old age.\n</p><p><i>Material Component: </i>A sprinkle of holy water and diamonds worth a total of at least 25,000 gp.\n</p>\n<hr/>\n\n\n\n</div>\n",
