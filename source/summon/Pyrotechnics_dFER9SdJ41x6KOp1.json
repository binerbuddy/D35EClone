Spell resistance can prevent blindness.\n</p><p><i>Smoke Cloud: </i>A writhing stream of smoke billows out from the source, forming a choking cloud. The cloud spreads 20 feet in all directions and lasts for 1 round per caster level. All sight, even darkvision, is ineffective in or through the cloud. All within the cloud take –4 penalties to Strength and Dexterity (Fortitude negates). These effects last for 1d4+1 rounds after the cloud dissipates or after the creature leaves the area of the cloud. Spell resistance does not apply.\n</p><p><i>Material Component: </i>The spell uses one fire source, which is immediately extinguished.

Magical fires are not extinguished, although a fire-based creature used as a source takes 1 point of damage per caster level.\n</p>\n<hr/>\n\n\n\n</div>\n",
